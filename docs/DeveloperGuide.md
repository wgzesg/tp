## 3. <a id="design">Design</a>
This section provides a high level overview of our application, The Schwarzenegger.
### 3.1. <a id="architecture">Architecture</a>

![Architecture](pictures/zesong/Architecture.png)

The image above explains the design of the application, The Schwarzenegger. 

The main driver of the application is `Main: Duke`. It is responsible for mainly two phases:
- At application launch
    - This class will initialise the components in the correct sequence and is in charge of connecting them with each other.
- At shut down
    - This class will invoke cleanup method for the components when necessary.
    
In addition to that, the architecture of The Schwarzenegger is broken down into several packages, mainly the following: 
- `Ui`: This class mainly handles the interactions with user of the application.
- `Parser`: This class mainly handles the parsing and handling of user commands.
- `Command`: This class handles the type of command.
- `Profile`: This class manages the data of the user.
- `Diet`: This class manages the diet recording sessions.
- `Workout`: This class manages the data workout recording sessions.
- `Storage`: This class reads data from and writes data back into a text file for future uses.

[Return to Top](#intro)

### 3.2. <a id="ui-component">Ui Component</a>
![Ui Component](pictures/zesong/Ui.png)
 
The `Ui` package is a combination class where the interactions with the user are formatted in a consistent way. 

The `Ui` component,

* Takes in user commands
* Formats messages and prints out responses

[Return to Top](#intro)

### 3.3. <a id="logic-component">Logic Component</a>

![Logic Component](pictures/zesong/Logic.png)

1. `The Schwarzenegger` uses `Parser` classes to parse the user command.
1. This splits the user input into interpretable portions by other functions.
1. All commands inherits from base class Command with an `execute()` method. They are stored in a hashmap `CommandLib` and retrieved using user's input as key.
1. Command interacts with parsers, models and storage to carry out the user's command.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a CommandResult object which is passed back to CommonUi to display the message. 

[Return to Top](#intro)

### 3.4. <a id="model-component">Model Component</a>

![Model Component](pictures/zesong/model.png)

The Model component contains `Profile`, `DietManager`,
`PastRecord` and `WorkoutSession` classes.
* Profile: Stores the user profile data.
* Food: Stores food data that user consumes in a meal.
* PastRecord: Stores meta information of each WorkoutSession files.
* Exercises: Stores the exercise data done in each workout session.

[Return to Top](#intro)

### 3.5. <a id="workoutSessionStorage-component">Storage Component</a>

Storage in the application refers to storing files of user profile and workout, diet sessions into respective local subdirectories sorted based on time in a local directory called `/saves` which is in the same directory as the project root.

#### 3.5.1. <a id="workoutSessionStorage-for-profile">Storage for Profile</a>

Storage for profile saves user profile created as `profile.json` in the `/saves/profile` directory. Profile data file is created as follows:
- `profile.json` is updated in the local hard disk after the user adds/ edits a profile by calling `ProfileAdd.execute()`/ `ProfileEdit.execute()`.
- `profile.json` content will be cleared after the user deletes a profile by calling `ProfileDelete.execute()`.

**Implementation**
Profile workoutSessionStorage handles reading of file data by calling `loadData()` and overwriting of file data by calling `saveData()`.

[Return to Top](#intro)
#### 3.5.2. <a id="workoutSessionStorage-for-diet">Storage for Diet</a>

Storage for diet saves diet sessions created as individual files sorted based on the time created in the `/saves/diet` directory. Each diet session file is created as follows:
- Each file is created as a json file and named as `[DATE] [TAG].json`.
- A corresponding file is updated in the local file after the user enters a command into a diet session by calling DietSessionEdit.execute(), or DietSessionCreate.execute().
- A corresponding file is deleted in the local file when the user deletes a diet session by calling DietSessionDelete.execute() or clears all diet sessions by calling DietSessionClear.execute().

**Implementation**
Storage handles reading of file data by calling readDietSession() and overwriting of file data by calling writeToStorageDietSession().

[Return to Top](#intro)
#### 3.5.3. <a id="workoutSessionStorage-for-workout">Storage for Workout</a>

Storage for workout saves workout sessions created as individual files named based on the time created in `/saves/workout` directory. The metainformation of the files such as createion date and last edit date is saved in  `/saves/workout/history.json`.

Only history.json file is load when initilizing the application. The rest of Session files are load on request, e.g. `edit`. When a new workout session is created, a new file will be stored and its meta information will be appended to `history.json`. When a workout session is deleted, the file will be removed and its record will be removed from `history.json`.

## 4. <a id="implementation">Implementation</a>
This section describes some details on how the features are being implemented. All profile/ diet/ workout-related features.


All profile/ diet/ workout-related features can be broken down into 4 distinct functionality, addition, viewing/ listing, deletion and editing.
For diet and workout-related features, there is an additional functionality of searching.

### 4.1. <a id="main-menu-related-features">Main Menu-related Features</a>
This feature allows user to access the different menu for workout, diet and profile. The failure to do so will trigger an exception where the user will be notified of the reason, e.g. invalid command. The action will be aborted, and the program will advise the user to type "help" for command syntax reference. 

If the command is successful,the user will be put into the respective menu and a starting message on the entered menu will be displayed to the user. 

**Implementation**

When the user attempts to access different menu for workout, diet and profile menu, the Duke, CommonUi, CommonParser and CommandLib classes will be accessed, and the following sequence of actions is called to prompt execution result to user:

1. User executes a command
    1. `Duke` calls `CommonUi.getCommand()` to receive user input.
    1. `Duke` calls `CommonParser.parseCommand()` to parse user input into a string array.
1. `Duke` calls `CommandLib.getCommand` with the string arry containing the inputs.
1. Depending on the input,`Duke` creates `ProfileSession` or `DietManager` or `WorkoutManager` object.
1. After entering the `ProfileSession` or `DietManager` or `WorkoutManager` objects, the menus will have their own separate tasks.

The sequence diagram below summarizes how Main Menu works:

[Return to Top](#intro)

### 4.2. <a id="profile-related-features">Profile-related Features</a>
#### 4.2.1. <a id="adding-a-profile">Adding a Profile</a>

This feature allows user to add a new profile. The failure to do so will trigger an exception where the user will be notified of the reason, e.g. invalid command format. The action will be aborted, and the program will advise the user to type "help" for command syntax reference. 

If the creation is successful, a confirmation message on the newly created profile will be displayed to the user. 

**Implementation**

When the user attempts to add a new profile, the ProfileSession, CommonUi, ProfileParser, Command, CommandLib, ProfileStorage, Profile and CommandResult classes will be accessed, and the following sequence of actions is called to prompt execution result to user:

1. User executes `add /n Schwarzenegger /h 188 /w 113 /e 100 /c 2500`
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `CommonUi.getCommand()` to receive user input.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `ProfileParser.parseCommand()` to parse user input into a string array.
1. Creating `ProfileAdd` object.
    1. Based on the parsed input, `ProfileSession` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `ProfileAdd`.
1. Executing command.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `ProfileAdd.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    1. `ProfileAdd` calls `ProfileStorage.loadData()` to load existing profile in the system. If there is an existing profile, `ProfileAdd` returns a failure result to `ProfileSession`. Otherwise, the process continues with step `3`.
    1. `ProfileAdd` calls `ProfileParser.extractCommandTagAndInfo()` to parse user input into specific tags and information. 
    1. Based on the parsed information from `ProfileParser.extractCommandTagAndInfo()`, `ProfileAdd` creates a new `Profile`.
    1. `ProfileAdd` calls `ProfileStorage.saveData()` to save the `Profile` object.
    1. `ProfileAdd` returns a successful result to `ProfileSession`.
1. Prompting result to user.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `CommandResult.getFeedbackMessage()` to get the execution feedback message.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `CommonUi.showToUser()` to show result to the user.

All descriptions, warnings and responses will be handled by `CommonUi` to ensure consistence across the app.

The sequence diagram below summarizes how creating a new profile works:

![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/khoa/AddProfile.png)

Below are the sub-diagrams: <a id="figure-4-2-1"></a>

![Figure 4.2.1](pictures/khoa/ParseInput.png)<br>
**Figure 4.2.1.** _Sub-diagram for Parsing Input in ProfileSession_

<a id="figure-4-2-2">![Figure 4.2.2](pictures/khoa/ShowMessage.png)</a><br>
**Figure 4.2.2.** _Sub-diagram for Showing Message to User in ProfileSession_

**Design considerations**

Parsing of the userâ€™s input command:

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Userâ€™s command is split into size 2 array first containing command type and command arguments. Then arguments are split into command tag and information pairs.  

    - Pros: Command tags do not have to follow a fixed order. 
    - Cons: It takes multiple steps in parsing the command.

- **Alternative 2:** Userâ€™s command is divided by space.

    - Pros: The parsing can be easily done by calling Java built-in function `split()`. Supports multiple tags or no tags.
    - Cons: Values for each variable cannot contain spaces which makes the application restrictive, especially for user's name.

[Return to Top](#intro)

#### 4.2.2. <a id="viewing-a-profile">Viewing a Profile</a>
This feature allows user to view added profile with calculated BMI based on height and weight. The failure to do so will trigger an exception where the user will be notified of the reason, e.g. redundant parameters. The action will be aborted, and the program will advise the user to type "help" for command syntax reference. 

If the data loading is successful, a message on the added profile will be displayed to the user. 

**Implementation**

When the user attempts to view an added profile, the ProfileSession, CommonUi, ProfileParser, Command, CommandLib, ProfileStorage, Profile, DietManager and CommandResult classes will be accessed. The following sequence of steps will then occur:

1. User executes `view`
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `CommonUi.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
    1. ProfileSession` calls `ProfileParser.parseCommand()` to parse user input into a string array.
1. Creating `ProfileView` object.
    1. Based on the parsed input, `ProfileSession` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `ProfileView`.
1. Executing command.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `ProfileView.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    1. `ProfileView` calls `ProfileStorage.loadData()` to load existing profile in the system. If there is no existing profile, `ProfileView` returns a failure result to `ProfileSession`. Otherwise, the process continues with step `3`.
    1. `ProfileView` calls `DietManager.getTodayTotalCalories()` to get user's calories intake today.
    1. Based on user's calories intake today and string representation of `Profile`, `ProfileView` returns a result to `ProfileSession`.    
1. Prompting result to user.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `CommandResult.getCommandResult()` to get the `CommandResult` object.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `CommonUi.showToUser()` to show result to the user.

All descriptions, warnings and responses will be handled by `CommonUi` to ensure consistence across the app.

The sequence diagram below summarizes how viewing an added profile works:

![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/khoa/ViewProfile.png)

You can refer to [Figure 4.2.1. Sub-diagram for Parsing Input in ProfileSession](#figure-4-2-1) and [Figure 4.2.2. Sub-diagram for Showing Message to User in ProfileSession](#figure-4-2-2) for the corresponding sub-diagrams.

**Design considerations**

Aspects: Loading of stored data

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** call public methods of Storage class to 
load the profile from hard disk every time the user wants to view profile.

    - Pros: Profile data is up-to-date if the user prefers to edit it in text file rather than using commands in The Schwarzenegger.
    - Cons: Execution time is slow down due to multiple times of loading the data.

- **Alternative 2:** call public methods of Storage class to load the profile from hard disk only when user enters Profile Menu.

    - Pros: Execution time is fast. 
    - Cons: Profile data is not updated in real time if user edits it in text editor while running The Schwarzenegger.

[Return to Top](#intro)

#### 4.2.3. <a id="editing-a-profile">Editing a Profile</a>
This feature allows user to anytime go back to edit a profile created in the past such as editing physique data and expected daily calories intake. The failure to do so will trigger an exception where the user will be notified of the reason, e.g. invalid command format. The action will be aborted, and the program will advise the user to type "help" for command syntax reference. 

If the editing is successful, a confirmation message on the edited profile will be displayed to the user. 

**Implementation**

When the user attempts to edit a profile, the ProfileSession, CommonUi, ProfileParser, Command, CommandLib, ProfileStorage, Profile and CommandResult classes will be accessed, and the following sequence of actions is called to prompt execution result to user:

1. User executes `edit /w 60`
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `CommonUi.getCommand()` to receive user input.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `ProfileParser.parseCommand()` to parse user input into a string array.
1. Creating `ProfileEdit` object.
    1. Based on the parsed input, `ProfileSession` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `ProfileEdit`.
1. Executing command.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `ProfileEdit.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    1. `ProfileEdit` calls `ProfileStorage.loadData()` to load existing profile in the system. If there is no existing profile, `ProfileAdd` returns a failure result to `ProfileSession`. Otherwise, the process continues with step `3`.
    1. `ProfileEdit` calls `ProfileParser.extractCommandTagAndInfo()` to parse user input into specific tags and information.
    1. Based on the parsed information from `ProfileParser.extractCommandTagAndInfo()`, `ProfileEdit` creates a new `Profile`.
    1. `ProfileEdit` calls `Profile.equals()` to compare the newly created and existing profile. If there are no changes, `ProfileEdit` returns a failure result to `ProfileSession`. Otherwise, the process continues with step `6`.
    1. `ProfileEdit` calls `ProfileStorage.saveData()` to save the newly created `Profile` object.
    1. `ProfileAdd` returns a successful result to `ProfileSession`.
1. Prompting result to user.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `CommandResult.getFeedbackMessage()` to get the execution feedback message.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `CommonUi.showToUser()` to show result to the user.

All descriptions, warnings and responses will be handled by `CommonUi` to ensure consistence across the app.

The sequence diagram below summarizes how creating a new profile works:

![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/khoa/EditProfile.png)

You can refer to [Figure 4.2.1. Sub-diagram for Parsing Input in ProfileSession](#figure-4-2-1) and [Figure 4.2.2. Sub-diagram for Showing Message to User in ProfileSession](#figure-4-2-2) for the corresponding sub-diagrams.

**Design considerations**

Parsing of the userâ€™s input command:

#### 4.2.4. <a id="deleting-a-profile">Deleting a Profile</a>

This feature allows user to delete a profile created in the past. The failure to do so will trigger an exception where the user will be notified of the reason, e.g. redundant parameters. The action will be aborted, and the program will advise the user to type "help" for command syntax reference. 

If the deletion is successful, a confirmation message on the profile deletion will be displayed to the user. 

**Implementation**

When the user attempts to delete an added profile, the ProfileSession, CommonUi, ProfileParser, Command, CommandLib, ProfileStorage, Profile and CommandResult classes will be accessed. The following sequence of steps will then occur:

1. User executes `delete`
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `CommonUi.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
    1. ProfileSession` calls `ProfileParser.parseCommand()` to parse user input into a string array.
1. Creating `ProfileDelete` object.
   1. Based on the parsed input, `ProfileSession` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `ProfileDelete`.
1. Executing command.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `ProfileDelete.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    1. `ProfileDelete` calls `ProfileStorage.loadData()` to load existing profile in the system. If there is no existing profile, `ProfileDelete` returns a failure result to `ProfileSession`. Otherwise, the process continues with step `3`.
    1. `ProfileDelete` calls `CommonUi.CheckConfirmation()` to get user's confirmation on the deletion since this action is irrevocable. If user  fails to confirm, `ProfileDelete` returns an abort result to `ProfileSession`. Otherwise, the process continues with step `4`.
    1. `ProfileDelete` calls `ProfileStorage.saveData()` to save a `null` object which represents a deleted profile.
    1. `ProfileDelete` returns a result to `ProfileSession`.   
1. Prompting result to user.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `CommandResult.getFeedbackMessage()` to get the execution feedback message.
    1. `ProfileSession` calls `CommonUi.showToUser()` to show result to the user.

#### 4.3.1. <a id="list-out-all-commands">Listing out all commands:</a> `help`
This command lists out all help commands in a typed list that indicates to the user all the commands available and how to use them.

**Implementation**  
When the user types `help` in a Diet Manager instance, the following sequence occurs. 

1. User executes `help`
    1. `DietManager` calls `dietManagerUi.getCommand()` to receive user input.
    1. `DietManager` calls `DietManagerParser.parseCommand()` to parse user input into a string array.
1. Creating `DietSessionHelp` object.
   1. Based on the parsed input, `DietManager` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `DietSessionHelp`.
1. Executing command.
    1. `DietManager` calls `DietSessionHelp.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    1. `DietSessionHelp` appends onto a string builder a list of typed help commands.

### 4.4. <a id="workout-related-features">Workout-related Features</a>
#### 4.4.1. <a id="creating-a-new-workout-session">Creating a New Workout Session</a>

Users can create a new workout session. The failure to do so will trigger an exception where the user will be notified 
of the reason, e.g. invalid command or IO related errors. The action will be aborted. If the creation is successful, 
the user will go into the new workout session to edit the exercises in that session.

The user can specify tags for the session. Creation time, last edit time and saving file name will be auto generated 
by the application and saved. 

**Implementation**

When the user attempts to create a new workout session, the Ui, WorkoutManagerParser 
and CommandLib class will be accessed and the following sequence of 
actions are called to return a command object NewWs.

1. User executes `new /t leg chest`
     1. `WorkoutManager` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
     2. `WorkoutManager` calls `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` into a string array
1. Creation of command object.
     1. Based on the parsed input, `WorkoutManager` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `NewWs`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `WorkoutManager` calls `NewWS.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    1. `NewWS` parse the arguments to identify the tags
    3. `NewWS` calls `PastRecordList.add()` to create a new file to store information in this session. 
    If the creation fails, the action is aborted. Else, this record will be stored and the file path will 
    be returned.
    4. `NewWS` creates a new `WorkoutSession` Object with the file path. 
    5.  `NewWS` calls `workoutSession. workoutSessionStart()` so that user can add information into this session.
    6. After user exits this workout, `WorkoutManager` returns a `CommandResult`.
1. Based on `CommandResult`, correct response will be printed to user.

All description, warnings and response will be handled by `Ui` to ensure consistence across the app.
The following sequence diagram shows how the new command works

The sequence diagram below summarizes how creating new workout session works:
![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/zesong/NewWS.png)
**Design considerations**
Parsing of the userâ€™s input command:  

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Userâ€™s commands are divided by space.

    - Pros: The parsing can be easily done by calling Java built-in function .split(). Supports multiple tags or no tags.
    - Cons: Values for each variable cannot contain spaces which makes the application restrictive.

- **Alternative 2:** Multiple prompts for userâ€™s input of a workout data.

    - Pros: Users would not have to make sure that their command is syntactically right. 
    - Cons: The constant prompting could subject the application to a negative experience in the difficulty to use the commands.

**Design considerations**
Aspects: Making add and its parameters as seperate or a single input

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Making add and its parameters as a single input

    - Pros: Would be easier for the user to enter as it takes less time to enter and it is not too difficult of a command.
    - Cons: It might cause the user to miss the format for inputting add.

- **Alternative 2:** Making add and its parameters as separate inputs

    - Pros: Would make it neater and more clear to the user what to enter as they would only enter one input every time.
    - Cons: It would take multiple actions to perform a single task, depending on the number of parameters.

![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/jinyang/WorkoutSessionDelete.png)

You can refer to [Figure 4.4.1.1.1. Sub-diagram for Parsing Input in WorkoutSession](#figure-4-4-1-1-1) and [Figure 4.4.1.1.2. Sub-diagram for Showing Message to User](#figure-4-4-1-1-2) for the corresponding sub-diagrams.

**Design considerations**
Aspects: Making delete and index to delete as separate or a single input

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Making delete and index to delete as a single input

    - Pros: Would be easier for the user to enter as it takes less time to enter and it is not too difficult of a command.
    - Cons: It might cause the user to miss the format for inputting delete.

- **Alternative 2:** Making delete and index to delete as separate inputs

    - Pros: Would make it neater and more clear to the user what to enter as they would only enter one input every time.
    - Cons: It would take two actions to perform a single task.

#### 4.4.1.3. <a id="listing-all-exercises-in-this-session">Listing All Exercises in This Session</a>

Users can list all exercise from a pre-existing list of exercise. The failure to do so will trigger an exception where the user will be notified of 
the reason, e.g. invalid command or IO related errors. The action will be aborted. If the listing is successful, 
the user will be able to see the full list of exercises.

**Implementation**

When the user attempts to list all exercises, the CommonUi, WorkoutSession, WorkoutSessionParser
, CommandLib, WorkoutSessionList and WorkoutSessionStorage class will be accessed and the following sequence of 
actions are called to return a CommandResult object containing a message to show to user.

1. User executes `list`
     1. `WorkoutSession` calls `CommonUi.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
     2. `WorkoutSession` calls `WorkoutSessionParser.workoutSessionParser` to convert the input to a string array.
1. Creation of command object.
     1. Based on the parsed input, `WorkoutSession` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `WorkoutSessionList`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `WorkoutSession` calls `WorkoutSessionList.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    2. `WorkoutSessionList` calls `WorkoutSessionList.printList()` to check if the list is empty.
    3. `WorkoutSessionList.printList()` calls `WorkoutSessionList.formatList()` to arrange the list in a readable and dynamic format for the user.
    3. `WorkoutSessionList.formatList()` returns a String of formatted output to `WorkoutSessionList.printList()` then to `WorkoutSessionList`. 
    4. `WorkoutSessionList` returns a `CommandResult` to `WorkoutSession`.
1. Based on `CommandResult`, correct response will be printed to user.

All description, warnings and response will be handled by `CommonUi` to ensure consistence across the app.

The sequence diagram below summarizes how the list command works:
![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/jinyang/WorkoutSessionList.png)

**Design considerations**
Aspects: Length of results

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make the length for displaying exercise dynamic

    - Pros: The table would look more appealing as the spacing would be dynamic.
    - Cons: It is a lot more difficult to code.

- **Alternative 2:** Make the length allocated for exercise really long

    - Pros: The code would be simpler.
    - Cons: The table would look ugly for the user to look at.

#### 4.4.1.4. <a id="searching-for-related-exercises">Searching for Related Exercises</a>

Users can search for an exercise from a pre-existing list of exercise. The failure to do so will trigger an exception where the user will be notified of 
the reason, e.g. invalid command or IO related errors. The action will be aborted. If the searching is successful, 
the user will be able to see the list of exercises that match.

**Implementation**

When the user attempts to search for an exercise from all exercises, the CommonUi, WorkoutSession, WorkoutSessionParser
, CommandLib, WorkoutSessionSearch and WorkoutSessionStorage class will be accessed and the following sequence of 
actions are called to return a CommandResult object containing a message to show to user.

1. User executes `search bench`
     1. `WorkoutSession` calls `CommonUi.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
     2. `WorkoutSession` calls `WorkoutSessionParser.workoutSessionParser` to convert the input to a string array.
1. Creation of command object.
     1. Based on the parsed input, `WorkoutSession` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `WorkoutSessionSearch`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `WorkoutSession` calls `WorkoutSessionSearch.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    2. `WorkoutSessionSearch` checks if the search term is empty. If it is empty, `WorkoutSessionSearch` returns a failure result to `WorkoutSession`. Otherwise, the process continues with step `3`
    3. `WorkoutSessionSearch` calls `WorkoutSessionSearch.formatList()` to search the search term with the exerciseList. If it is empty, `WorkoutSessionSearch.formatList()` returns a failure result to `WorkoutSession`. Otherwise, the process continues with step `4`
    4. `WorkoutSessionSearch` returns a `CommandResult` to `WorkoutSession`.
1. Based on `CommandResult`, correct response will be printed to user.

All description, warnings and response will be handled by `CommonUi` to ensure consistence across the app.

#### 4.4.2. <a id="listing-past-workout-sessions">Listing Past Workout Sessions</a>
The feature to list workoutSessions allows the user to view a summary of all the history workout sessions, including their index, creation date and tags.

**Implementation**
When the user attempts to list workoutSessions, the WorkoutManger, WorkoutManagerParse, ListWS and WorkoutManagerStorage class will be called upon. The following sequence of steps will then occur:

1. User executes `list /s 20201010 /e 20201025`
     1. `WorkoutManager` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
     2. `WorkoutManager` calls `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` into a string array
1. Creation of command object.
     1. Based on the parsed input, `WorkoutManager` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `ListWS`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `WorkoutManager` calls `ListWS.execute()` to execute the command
    3. `ListWS` calls `PastRecordList.list()`
    1. `PastRecordList` will return formatted list.
    6. `WorkoutManager` returns a `CommandResult` which contains the formatted list and execution result.
1. Based on `CommandResult`, correct response will be printed to user.

![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/zesong/ListWS.png)

**Design considerations**
Aspects: Security of stored data

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** call public methods of Storage class to 
print the list

    - Pros: pastRecord are private and it can only be manipulated through designed public methods. Only selected data will be printed and viewed.
    - Cons: Most methods Storage needs to be a static.

- **Alternative 2:** Storage return a readonly list of pastRecord.

    - Pros: More versatile operations can be done.
    - Cons: All data of pastRecord will be exposed.

[Return to Top](#intro)

#### 4.4.3. <a id="editing-workout-session">Editing Workout Session</a>
User can anytime go back to edit a workout session created in the past such as
adding or removing exercies in that session.

Each past workout session is stored in a different file name following its creation time.
The meta information of these past records such as file name, creation time are
stored in another file which will be loaded as the program initlises.
The actual workout session record will only be loaded if needed e.g. when editting is called. 

**Implementation**
When the user attempts to edit a past workout session, the Ui, WorkoutManagerParser, CommandLib and WorkoutStorage class will be accessed and the following sequence of 
actions are called.

1. User executes `edit 1`
     1. `WorkoutManager` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
     2. `WorkoutManager` calls `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` into a string array
1. Creation of command object.
     1. Based on the parsed input, `WorkoutManager` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `EditWS`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `WorkoutManager` calls `EditWS.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    3. `EditWS` calls `PastRecordList.edit()` to locate the file. If the does not exist, the action is aborted. Else, `PastRecordList` updates the meta information of the file and write to local workoutSessionStorage. The file path will be returned.
    4. `EditWS` creates a new `WorkoutSession` Object with the file path. `WorkoutSession` is initilised by loading the data in the file.
    5.  `EditWS` calls `workoutSession.workoutSessionStart()` so that user start editing this session.
    6. After user exits this workout, `WorkoutManager` returns a `CommandResult`.
1. Based on `CommandResult`, correct response will be printed to user.

All description, warnings and response will be handled by `Ui` to ensure consistence across the app.
The following sequence diagram shows how the new command works

The sequence diagram below summarizes how editting past record works:
![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/zesong/EditWS.png)
**Design considerations**
Past record workoutSessionStorage and model design:  

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** store past workout sessions in different files and their meta information in a separate file

    - Pros: Initialization will be faster as data loaded grows little even in long terms. 
    - Cons: Deleting files and creating files need to handle file names carefully.

- **Alternative 2:** Load all past records during initialization.

    - Pros:  Run time can retrieve data faster as there is no need to access data in hard disk. 
    - Cons: The application initialization will grow quickly as the application scales.

[Return to Top](#intro)
#### 4.4.4. <a id="deleting-a-workout-session">Deleting a workout Session </a>
User can delete a workout session created in the past by giving its index.

Each past workout session is stored in a different file name following its creation time. The meta information of these past records such as file name, creation time are stored in another file which will be loaded as the program initlises. When the user tries to delete a file, the application refers to the meta information of the file to locate the file and delete it. Then the meta information of the record will be deleted.

User can clear all data by iteratively delete the record until the meta data file is empty. To simplify that, user can use `clear` command to achieve that.

**Implementation**

When the user attempts to delete a past workout session, the Ui, WorkoutManagerParser, CommandLib
and WorkoutStorage class will be accessed and the following sequence of actions are called.

1. User executes `delete 1` or `clear`
     1. `WorkoutManager` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
     2. `WorkoutManager` calls `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` into a string array
1. Creation of command object.
     1. Based on the parsed input, `WorkoutManager` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `DeleteWS`
     or `clearWS`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `WorkoutManager` calls `DeleteWS.execute()` with the rest of parsed input.
    3. `DeleteWS` calls `PastRecorList.delete()` to locate the file. If the does not exist, the action is aborted. Else, `PastRecorList` remove the meta information of the file and delete the local workoutSessionStorage file.
    6. After user exits this workout, `WorkoutManager` returns a `CommandResult`.
1. Based on `CommandResult`, correct response will be printed to user.

All description, warnings and response will be handled by `Ui` to ensure consistence across the app.

The sequence diagram below summarizes how deleting past record works:
![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/zesong/DeleteWS.png)

**Design considerations**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete `workoutSession` by specifying index of it.

    - Pros: Quick and easy deletion by using ArrayList.get().
    - Cons: Lesser alternatives for the user and user would have to identify the index first by executing `list` to get index of the session to be deleted.

- **Alternative 2:** Delete `workoutSession` by specifying `workoutSession` tags or dates.

    - Pros: More alternatives for users. Can bulk delete files with certain attributes. 
    - Cons: Tags and dates does not uniquely identify the record hence may result in accidental wrong deletion.

[Return to Top](#intro)
#### 4.4.5. <a id="searching-based-on-conditions">Searching Based on Conditions</a>
The feature `search` allows the user to view a summary of all the history 
workout sessions which satisfies certain conditions.

The user can search by the date of creation, or the tags that the session has. User can put in 0
or 1 or 2 criteria during search. 


The user can attach variable number of tags after `/t` and one date after `/d`. The date must be specified in certain formats for it to be recognisable. Else, it will be treated as there is no date criteria given.
[See here](#appendix-e-supported-formats-of-date-input) for all supported formats.

The tag criterion selects sessions which contains all the tags that the user specified in the search. The date criterion selects the sessions which is created on that date. Only sessions that satisfies all conditions will be selected and displayed.

The result is displayed in a table with the index of the selected records so that users can easily do further operations on them, e.g. `delete` or `edit`.
 
 **Implementation**
 
When the user attempts to list workoutSessions, the WorkoutManger, DeleteWS, WorkoutManagerStorage and WorkoutManagerParse class will be called upon. The following sequence of steps will then occur:

1. User executes `search /t leg /d 20201017`
     1. `WorkoutManager` calls `Ui.getUserCommand()` to receive user input.
     2. `WorkoutManager` calls `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` into a string array
1. Creation of command object.
     1. Based on the parsed input, `WorkoutManager` calls `CommandLib` to return the correct Command Object `SearchWS`.
1. Executing Command
    1. `WorkoutManager` calls `SearchWS.execute()` to execute the command
    3. `SearchWS` calls `PastRecorList.search()`
    1. `PastRecordList` will call `WorkoutManagerParser.parse` to parse the arguments into an array of predicates
    1. `PastRecordList` filters the pastRecord arraylist and return a string representation of the filtered records to `WorkoutManager`
    6. `WorkoutManager` returns a `CommandResult`.
1. Based on `CommandResult`, correct response will be printed to user.

The sequence diagram below summarizes how searching record works:
![Load Data Sequence Diagram](pictures/zesong/SearchWS.png)
**Design considerations**
Aspects: indexing the selected results

The index of a record is not stored in the schema because it easily varies with addition and deletion. Thus given a record, searching for its index will have higher time complexity.

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** print out the actual index of the record 
in the meta info file.

    - Pros: The index is useful for user to use for future actions.
    - Cons: Checking for the actual location complicates the search time complexity.

- **Alternative 2:** print out the index of the element in the result list.

    - Pros: Easy to implement. Low time complexity.
    - Cons: Since the index in result list is not the same as the index in actual record meta, user cannot use the index for further actions.

### 4.5. <a id="logging">Logging</a>
Logging in the application refers to storing exceptions, warnings and messages that occur during the execution of Kitchen Helper. It was included to help developers to identify bugs and to simplify their debugging process. 

The `java.util.logging` package in Java is used for logging. The logging mechanism can be managed from the `SchwarzeneggerLogger` class through the `logger` attribute. 

All controls of the logger for the application can be viewed/ altered in the class construction. The current settings for the logger are as follow:

- All information is logged into a log file, `SchwarzeneggerLogs.log`.
- Logging is made to be displayed in the `SimpleFormatter` style where the date, class and error description are recorded.

Logging Levels:
- `Level.SEVERE`: a serious failure, which prevents normal execution of the program, for end users and system administrators.
- `Level.WARNING`: a potential problem, for end users and system administrators.
- `Level.INFO`: reasonably significant informational message for end users and system administrators.
- `Level.CONFIG`: hardware configuration, such as CPU type.
- `Level.FINE`, `Level.FINER`, `Level.FINEST`: three levels used for providing tracing information for the software developers.

`SchwarzeneggerLogger` follows singleton design pattern. Thus, other classes can access the `logger` by calling `SchwarzeneggerLogger.getInstanceLogger()`, and logging can be done by invoking the function `log()`. This will ensure that all loggings will be made to the same file across the various classes. 

An example is shown below:

```
private static Logger logger = SchwarzeneggerLogger.getInstanceLogger();
logger.log(Level.WARNING, DESCRIPTION_OF_WARNING, e.toString());
```
